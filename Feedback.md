Well done. This is complete. I like the analysis. I agree it may not have a ton of "wow", but it's nicely done. You should
consider writing it up for some sort of blog post (unless that's already been done). Some other thoughts for you: 

* You include `glob` but don't use it. I applaud the not using it, since I think students often use it as a 
blunt instrument to do things that are done with more precision in `os`. Just check those includes when you
finish a piece of work to ensure you use all the code you include. 

* You write "It sounds inneficient and hard to keep track of". I disagree; I think nested dictionaries are
often an elegant way to store data, particularly data like this. (Also, check your spelling on your write-ups! "Inneficient"?)
I like your write-up about what's in the dictionaries, just make that a bulleted list. 

* All the EDA stuff is cool and interesting. Nice work. This is the place I was hoping more members of the class could
have gotten to -- just exploring an interesting data set with clever questions and looking for patterns. 

* You missed a perfect opportunity for a regex to handle the `[shakes hand]` situation.

* I like to be consistent with my column name format, regardless of the context. So my spidey sense
tingles when I see `negative` and `Pct_Pos`. I'd call that second one `pct_pos` or something to stay 
consistent. Cool analysis in this section, however. I'd just round the output when you write it out, however
rather than when storing it in your `totals` dictionary.

* I agree with you that the sentiment scoring by character is almost exactly what I would expect. Neat.

* I'm not sure the lists by every every derived sentiment score get us that much, but I appreciate the fact
that you didn't print out all 700 characters. That's what most would have done...
